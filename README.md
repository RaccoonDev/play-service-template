# Play Service Template

In this repository I'm experimenting with sceleton of a potential service in modern SOA environment.

In the same time this repository represents step by step construction of the service. I tried to document motivation and caviats of every step in commit messages.

To see the whole journey step-by-step you can either check commit messages using GitHub UI or if you checkout the repository you can run:
`git log --graph --decorate --all` (in case you are using oh-my-zsh git plugin it is alias `glgga`).
